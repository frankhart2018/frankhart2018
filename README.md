Hi, I am Siddhartha, Software Engineer at Avalara interested in Neural Networks and Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Compiler Design. I love building tools which people can use in their development pipeline. Apart from my day job as a Software Developer I develop open source tools.

The projects that I am currently working on are:-

- simC https://github.com/cimplec/sim-c licensed under GPL v3
- Project DC (Private repo as of now :grimacing:, will soon be open sourced :wink:)
- Pulse https://github.com/lang-pulse/Pulse yet to be open sourced

I also take part in ML research (:books: :books:) and have worked on several research projects based on Neural Networks and Machine Learning.

Looking to collaborate (ðŸ‘¯) and get in touch with people who are as enthusiastic about AI and Compilers like me.
