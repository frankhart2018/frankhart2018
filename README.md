Hi, I am Siddhartha, Software Engineer interested in Neural Networks and Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Compiler Design. I love building tools which people can use in their development pipeline. Apart from my day job as a Software Developer I develop open source tools, some of the tools I am working on right now are:-

- simC <a href="https://github.com/cimplec/sim-c">simC Repo</a> licensed under GPL v3
- Project DC (Private repo as of now :grimacing:, will soon be open sourced :wink:)
- Pulse <a href="https://github.com/lang-pulse/Pulse">Pulse Repo</a> yet to be open sourced

Looking to collaborate (ðŸ‘¯) with people who are as enthusiastic about AI and Compilers like me.
