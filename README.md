Hi, I am Siddhartha, Software Engineer at Avalara interested in Neural Networks and Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Compiler Design. I love building tools which people can use in their development pipeline. Apart from my day job as a Software Developer I develop open source tools.

The projects that I am currently working on are:-

- <a href="https://github.com/cimplec/sim-c">simC</a> - A simple high level dynamically typed front-end for C. (Licensed under GPL v3)
- <a href="https://github.com/Project-DC/pygeneses">Pygeneses</a> - A PyTorch based Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework to study behaviour of artificial agents in bio-inspired environments. (Licensed under GPL v3)
- <a href="https://github.com/lang-pulse/">Pulse</a> - An interpreted language optimized for Neural Networks. (Yet to be open sourced)
- <a href="https://github.com/Documentive/TemplateBuddy">TemplateBuddy</a> -  A project for making resumes and research papers using latex (Licensed under GPL v3)

I also take part in ML research (:books: :books:) and have worked on several research projects based on Neural Networks and Machine Learning.

Looking to collaborate (ðŸ‘¯) and get in touch with people who are as enthusiastic about AI and Compilers like me.
